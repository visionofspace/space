I've made this channel because I noticed that very few Indians are aware of and interested in the advancement made by astronomy. So I decided to make a Youtube channel so that I can tell you many interesting things about space.
So subscribe my channel Vision of space and stay tuned to know many interesting things about our universe. 

NOTE - New videos are uploaded every Sunday

Subscribe the channel - @visionofspace
Share with your friends # space
